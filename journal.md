# Journal Entry - [Jul 28th 2024]
This is the beginning of the journey. I basically need to downsize and rather than finding an analog way to do that, naturally I need to make a git repo for it. So many thoughts in my head and want to have a space to share these in a way where people can use this same technique to minimize or declutter their life.
As outlined in the first draft of the goals in this repo, this program should live in the terminal as I spend a lot of time in a terminal or an IDE.
In the near future this should also send notifications to the user to a provided phone number or email to remind you to revisit, remind, or showcase the work you did at decluttering.
Would this also be a good repo for devs to share their thoughts in their heads?? They can just do this on their own repo so why would they want to use this? Maybe that isn't a good idea, but it is an idea.
This will remaind free and open source as that is how information adn the sharing of should be. I have no idea where this could go but I want to create so thanks for being here, let's make something cool.
