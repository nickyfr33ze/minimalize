# Minimalize your life already, dude.
A simple repository to help someone decides on stuff they can or want to get rid of. This is to help devs make a running list of stuff they may not need.
Feel free to use this as a type of list of stuff to get rid of, a place to put your thoughts on items and your attachment (or lack of) to them.

## Why make this?
Why not just use Apple Notes, or Obsidian? 
You can certainly use those, I have for many years. However for as much time as I spend in a terminal or IDE I want to be able to quickly make notes on what'g going on in my noggin of stuff I don't need...
... I got a lot of stuff in my head and if you're anything like me, the sooner they get out, the quicker you can get back to what you were doing.

## Goals for this App
1. Cross compatibility. Make this work on Windows, macOS, and Linux distros. I use all of them and want to make sure this works with all of them. 
2. Alerts. What is the use of writing something down if you never come back to it? This app should send either emails, texts, or some other notification service to remind you to re-visit this space.
3. Memes. This should allow the user a space to also express their creativity. Minimalizing isn't exactly fun if it is your first time doing it, it can be rather stressful. This should be safe for new users and easy to grasp, but also allow advanced users who know what they are doing to just DO IT <insert Shia Lebouf>
4. Work solely in the terminal to appeal to the dev and security reseacher communities.
    * Might expand into a pretty/flashy UI, but that is a longer term goal.
